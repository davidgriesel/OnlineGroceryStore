# Online Grocery Store
## Overview
An online grocery store that connects with customers through a mobile app aims to refine its marketing strategy. By deepening their understanding into the different kinds of customers they have and how their order behaviour differ, they aim to leverage data driven insights to inform a more targeted marketing strategy.


## Goals
Perform an exploratory analysis of customer demographics and transactional data to gain insights into ordering behaviours, thereby enhancing customer profiling and optimising marketing strategies through targeted product placement.


## Objectives
### Ordering Trends
- Categorise products into price ranges, and analyse order volumes, spending trends, and product popularity to optimise advertisement scheduling and product placement.

### Customer Profiling & Behaviour
- Profile customers based on ordering behaviour and demographic information and analyse how order habits vary across these profiles.


## Key Questions 
### Ordering Trends
- How does order volume fluctuate over time?
- How does average spending per product vary over time? 
- How can products be categorised into price ranges to support product placement?
- Which products, within their respective departments and categories, are ordered the most?

### Customer Profiling & Behaviour
- How can ordering behaviour and demographics be used to profile customers?
- How does ordering habits vary across customer profiles?
- Are there differences in ordering habits between customer profiles?


## Data
The following data was used in the analysis:
